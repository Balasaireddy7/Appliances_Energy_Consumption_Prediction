# Appliances Energy Consumption Prediction

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict household appliance energy consumption based on a combination of indoor environmental conditions (such as temperature and humidity across various rooms) and external weather data (including wind speed, visibility, and dew point temperature).

## Files Included
- `Appliances Energy Consumption Prediction.docx`: Complete project understanding and steps 
- `Appliances Energy Consumption Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing full code for preprocessing, scaling, spliting, model training, predicting, hyperparameter tuning
- `energydata_complete.csv.csv`: Raw sensor dataset.

## Steps to Run the Notebook

### 1. Setup Environment
Install the required Python libraries if not already installed:
```bash
%pip install pandas
%pip install matplotlib
%pip install seaborn
%pip install scikit-learn
```

### 2. Open Jupyter Notebook
Use Jupyter or Google Colab to run the notebook:
```bash
Appliances Energy Consumption Prediction.ipynb
```
